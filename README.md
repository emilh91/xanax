# xanax
Improved Leaderboard and Intel views for Neptune's Pride

# Why the name?
[Xanax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alprazolam) is used to treat anxiety disorders. Further interpretation is up to the user. ( ͝° ͜ʖ ͝°)   
Originally (in a previous game), this project was called `anax`.  
I lost the code for that and made a new dashboard view using Angular.  
I decided to prepend an 'x' to the name to form a palindrome and a real word.
